### Theory 
**01. Linear Regression (Ridge, Lasso) from scratch**
 * implement linear regression using the least squares method 
 * use learning curves plot to understand whether the linear model is overfitting or underfitting
 * extend model with polynomial basis expansions and regularizations (Ridge and Lasso) using Skit-learn
 * use k-fold cross validation to obtain the optimal hyper-parameters for the models


### Toy project 
**01. Image classification with CNN and transfer learning**  
  * [go to repository]()
  * build CNN to classify the MNIST dataset using Tensorflow and Keras API (acheive over 99% accuracy)
  * finetune Rasnet50 to classify CIFAR-10 dataset (achieve over 90% accuracy)

### Paper review 
**01. On Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive Bayes (Andrew Ng)**
  * [orginal paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020-on-discriminative-vs-generative-classifiers-a-comparison-of-logistic-regression-and-naive-bayes.pdf) 
  * [go to repository (paperReview/01)]() 
  * implement the Naïve Bayes Classifier from scratch using NumPy
  * compare the Naïve Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression on different datasets (continuous, binary and categorical datasets) and reproduce the result of the paper
