## Theory üìö
**01. Linear Regression (Ridge, Lasso) from scratch**
 * [code](https://github.com/SongYi-Han/ML-theory-and-practice/tree/main/theory/01)
 * Implement linear regression using the least squares method 
 * Use learning curves plot to understand whether the linear model is overfitting or underfitting
 * Extend model with polynomial basis expansions and regularizations (Ridge and Lasso) using Sklearn
 * Use k-fold cross validation to obtain the optimal hyper-parameters for the models


## Practice ü§ñ
Objective : getting used to built-in models and functions in Tensorflow  
  
**01. Classification with Decision Tree** 
 * [code](https://github.com/SongYi-Han/ML-theory-and-practice/blob/main/practice/01/dTree.ipynb)
 * classify iris and breast cancer datasets using sklearn and display the decision tree using Graphviz  
 
**02. Binary classification with SVM**
 * [code]()
 * classify diabetes and mushroom datasets using sklearn   
 * load the dataset from local and using url
 * standardize the datasets
 * convert nominal data to numeric data 
 
**03. Clustering with kmeans**
 * [code]()
 * classify iris and wine datasets using sklearn   
 
**04. Image classification with CNN and transfer learning**  
 * [code]()
 * build CNN to classify the MNIST dataset using Tensorflow and Keras API (acheive over 99% accuracy)
 * finetune Rasnet50 to classify CIFAR-10 dataset (achieve over 90% accuracy)

## Paper review üìù
**01. On Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive Bayes (Andrew Ng)**
  * [orginal paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020-on-discriminative-vs-generative-classifiers-a-comparison-of-logistic-regression-and-naive-bayes.pdf) 
  * [code](https://github.com/SongYi-Han/ML-theory-and-practice/blob/main/paperReview/01/NBCvsLR.ipynb) 
  * implement the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier from scratch using NumPy
  * compare the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression on different datasets (continuous, binary and categorical datasets) and reproduce the result of the paper
